How to Use the Script:
Save the script: Save it as a .py file on your local machine.
Install dependencies: Make sure BeautifulSoup4 and matplotlib are installed, which you can install via pip if not already present:
Copy code
pip install beautifulsoup4 matplotlib
Run the script: Execute the script in your Python environment.
Adjust the file_path variable to the path where your OFX file is located. This script will then read the file, parse and categorize transactions, summarize them, and display a pie chart.
